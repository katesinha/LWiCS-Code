Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of <em>Europe's major centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce, fashion, gastronomy, science, and arts</em>. The <u>City of Paris is the centre and seat of government of the region and province of Île-de-France</u>, or Paris Region, which has an estimated population of 12,174,880, or about 18 percent of the population of France as of 2017. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit Worldwide Cost of Living Survey in 2018, Paris was the <strong>second most expensive city in the world</strong>, after Singapore and ahead of Zürich, Hong Kong, Oslo, and Geneva.

		<h2 >All About Istanbul</h2>
		<p id="Istanbul" cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul">Istanbul is the <strong>largest city in Turkey</strong> and <u>the country's economic, cultural and historic center</u>. The city straddles the Bosphorus strait, and lies in both Europe and Asia, with a <strong>population of over 15 million residents</strong>, comprising 19% of the population of Turkey. Istanbul is the <em>most populous city in Europe</em>, and the world's fifteenth-largest city. Founded as Byzantion by Megarian colonists in 657 BCE, and renamed by Constantine the Great first as New Rome (Nova Roma) during the official dedication of the city as the new Roman capital in 330 CE, which he soon afterwards changed as Constantinople (Constantinopolis), <u>the city grew in size and influence</u>, becoming a beacon of the Silk Road and one of the most important cities in history. It <em>served as an imperial capital for almost sixteen centuries</em>, during the Roman/Byzantine (330–1204), Latin (1204–1261), Byzantine (1261–1453), and Ottoman (1453–1922) empires.</p>

		<h2>All About Ljubljana</h2>
		<p id="Ljubljana" cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ljubljana">Ljubljana is the <strong>capital and largest city of Slovenia</strong>. It is the <u>cultural, educational, economic, political and administrative centre of the country</u>. During antiquity, a Roman city called Emona stood in the area. Ljubljana itself was first mentioned in the first half of the 12th century. Situated at the middle of a trade route between the northern Adriatic Sea and the Danube region, it was the <em>historical capital of Carniola</em>, one of the Slovene-inhabited parts of the Habsburg Monarchy. It was under Habsburg rule from the Middle Ages until the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918. After World War II, Ljubljana became the capital of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia, part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It retained this <strong>status until Slovenia became independent in 1991 and Ljubljana became the capital of the newly formed state</strong>.</p>
